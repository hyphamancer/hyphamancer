There are a few things I would change. It was raining outside so I used my car as a tripod to take these shots. My camera is super sensitive to motion and considering it has no image stabilization at all. So, having my car running while trying to take photos made every photo blurry. I didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t notice it on the view finder. Secondly, I should&amp;amp;rsquo;ve brought my batteries and for whatever reason the camera kept shutting down. So, I had to be quick with my shots. I&amp;amp;rsquo;m not sure if this raspberry pi has a thermal issue or I did something wrong but it gets super hot super fast. I should check the journalctl to see if CamUI is causing the pi to crash or if its overheating.
